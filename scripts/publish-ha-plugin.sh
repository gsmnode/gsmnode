# Publish "Home Assistant Plugin/" to the public GitHub repo HACS installs from.
#
# HACS requires custom_components/<domain>/ at the root of the repository, so
# the plugin cannot be installed from this monorepo directly. This splits the
# folder out into its own commit history — where custom_components/gsmnode/ is
# at the top level — and pushes that to GitHub.
#
# The monorepo stays the source of truth. Nothing here is a fork: the split is
# recomputed from scratch every run, so the public repo is always exactly what
# this folder contains.
#
# First run, once:
#   git remote add github-gsmnode-ha https://github.com/gsmnode/gsmnode-ha.git
#
# Then, from the repo root:
#   sh scripts/publish-ha-plugin.sh
#
# A different remote or branch can be passed as the first and second argument.
