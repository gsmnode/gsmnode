# gsmnode — Home Assistant Integration

A custom Home Assistant integration that sends SMS, places phone calls, and
hears back from the gateway when messages and calls arrive — through the gsmnode
**API Server**.

```
Home Assistant ──► API Server (/api/messages, /api/calls) ──► your phone ──► SMS / call
Home Assistant ◄── API Server (webhooks)                  ◄── your phone ◄── SMS / call
```

Like every other client, it talks **only** to the API Server (never PocketBase).

**There is no YAML.** Every part of this — the connection, the sidebar item,
which events arrive, and every notification target — is set from the Home
Assistant UI, and nothing goes in `configuration.yaml`.

## What you get

- **UI setup** (config flow) — add it under *Settings → Devices & Services*, and
  change the URL or password later without losing your entities (*Reconfigure*).
- **Actions** — `gsmnode.send` takes the lot: SMS, MMS or a call, to whichever
  numbers, from whichever phone and SIM, now or later. `gsmnode.send_sms` and
  `gsmnode.call` remain as short forms. The phone is a picker, not a typed id.
- **Sensors** — a `binary_sensor` "API Server" (is the gateway up?) plus one
  connectivity sensor **per registered phone**, so an automation can react to
  the phone that actually sends your texts dropping off.
- **Incoming events** *(optional)* — tick the gateway events you care about and
  they arrive on the Home Assistant bus, ready for an Event trigger. The webhook
  is registered at both ends for you. See below.
- **Notification targets** *(optional)* — add as many as you like, each its own
  notify entity with its own type, phone, SIM and recipients. See below.
- **Sidebar item** *(optional)* — a **gsmnode** entry in Home Assistant's left
  menu that opens the Web App or the API Server panel in place. See below.
- **Branding** — the gsmnode mark and wordmark ship in `brand/`, so the
  integration carries its own icon instead of a puzzle piece (Home Assistant
  **2026.3+**; older versions ignore the folder). The two actions get icons on
  any version through `icons.json`.

## Install

Needs Home Assistant **2025.3** or newer — notification targets are config
subentries, which older versions cannot show.

### With HACS

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open this repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=gsmnode&repository=gsmnode-ha&category=integration)

Until it lands in the HACS default store, add it as a custom repository:

1. **HACS → ⋮ (top right) → Custom repositories**.
2. Repository `https://github.com/gsmnode/gsmnode-ha`, type **Integration**
   → **Add**.
3. Search HACS for **gsmnode** → **Download**.
4. **Restart Home Assistant** (Settings → System → Restart).

The button above does steps 1–3 for you. Once the integration is in the default
store, none of this is needed — it will simply be there to search for.

### By hand

1. Copy `custom_components/gsmnode/` from this repository into your Home
   Assistant config directory, so it lands at:

   ```
   <config>/custom_components/gsmnode/
   ```

   That is next to your `configuration.yaml`. Use the Samba / File editor / SSH
   add-on, or the mapped volume for Docker.

2. **Restart Home Assistant** (Settings → System → Restart).

## Add it from the UI

1. **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**.
2. Search for **gsmnode**.
3. Fill in the form:
   - **API Server URL** — e.g. `http://192.0.2.10:8080` (must be reachable from HA)
   - **Email** / **Password** — a gateway user. Make one in the Web App, or on
     the API Server host with
     `node scripts/create-user.mjs ha@local "pass" "Home Assistant"`
   - **Default phone** *(optional)* — pin sends/calls to a specific phone, by its
     device ID

   The form validates by logging in; you'll get *Invalid auth* or *Cannot
   connect* if something's wrong.

A **gsmnode** device appears with an **API Server** connectivity sensor, and
each phone registered to that account gets its own device and sensor beneath it.

If the password changes on the gateway, Home Assistant raises a
**Reauthentication** notification instead of silently failing; if the server
moves, use **Reconfigure** on the integration.

## Use it

### Send anything

`gsmnode.send` is one action for all three kinds. Every field below has a picker
in the automation editor — the type is a dropdown, the phone is a device list,
the SIM is a number box:

```yaml
action: gsmnode.send
data:
  type: sms                 # sms | mms | call
  phone_numbers: ["+15551234567"]
  message: "Hello from Home Assistant"
  device: 4a7f…             # optional: which phone, from the device picker
  sim_number: 0             # optional: 0-based slot, works for calls too
  schedule_at: "2026-07-22 18:30:00"   # optional (not for calls)
```

An MMS adds a subject and attachments; a call ignores the message and rings each
number in turn:

```yaml
action: gsmnode.send
data:
  type: mms
  phone_numbers: ["+15551234567"]
  subject: "Front door"
  message: "Someone at the door"
  attachments: ["/config/www/snapshot.jpg"]
```

```yaml
action: gsmnode.send
data:
  type: call
  phone_numbers: ["+15551234567"]
  sim_number: 1
```

Attachments are read off disk, so each path has to be under an
`allowlist_external_dirs` directory, and each file at most 1 MB.

`sim_number` here is a **slot index**, not a picker. Action fields come from a
static `services.yaml` that Home Assistant reads once for every install, so it
cannot list SIMs that differ per gateway and per phone — only a config flow can
do that, which is why notification targets get the real list. To see which slot
is which, open a phone's connectivity sensor: its attributes carry the same
`slot`, `carrier` and `number` the picker uses.

### Short forms

```yaml
action: gsmnode.send_sms
data:
  phone_numbers: ["+15551234567"]
  message: "Hello from Home Assistant"
  sim_number: 0         # optional (dual-SIM; slots count from 0)
```

```yaml
action: gsmnode.call
data:
  phone_number: "+15551234567"
  sim_number: 1         # optional
```

With more than one gateway configured, add `config_entry_id:` to say which one
to use — the automation editor offers a picker for it. `device` (the picker) and
`device_id` (the gateway's own id) are interchangeable; `device_id` wins if both
are given.

### Example automation

```yaml
# Built in the automation editor; this is only what it looks like underneath.
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.basement_leak
    to: "on"
actions:
  - action: gsmnode.send_sms
    data:
      phone_numbers: ["+15551234567"]
      message: "Water leak detected in the basement!"
  - action: gsmnode.call
    data:
      phone_number: "+15551234567"
```

### React to the gateway going offline

```yaml
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.gsmnode_api_server
    to: "off"
    for: "00:02:00"
actions:
  - action: persistent_notification.create
    data:
      title: "gsmnode"
      message: "The API Server is unreachable."
```

The same trigger shape works on a phone's own sensor (its entity id comes from
the phone's name) — useful when the API Server is up but the phone that does the
sending has stopped routing.

## The sidebar item

The gateway already has two full overviews — the Web App and the API Server's
own panel — so the integration does not reimplement either. It puts an item in
Home Assistant's sidebar that opens the one you choose, in place, without
leaving Home Assistant.

Set it up under **Settings → Devices & Services → gsmnode → Configure →
Sidebar item**:

| Overview to show | Opens |
|---|---|
| **No sidebar item** | nothing — the default |
| **Web App** | the full gateway UI: messages, inbox, devices, webhooks, settings |
| **API Server panel** | status and administration: users, plugins, connected devices |
| **Another address** | any URL you give it |

The address is worked out for you: the API Server panel is the URL you signed in
against, and the Web App's is whatever the API Server reports for it on
`/api/status` — both shown in the form. Fill the **Address** field in only when
that is not the address your *browser* needs. The panel is loaded by the
browser, not by Home Assistant, so a container name or a `localhost` that means
something different on the two machines has to be overridden here.

**Sidebar title** names the item — worth setting if you run more than one
gateway — and **Administrators only** hides it from non-admin users. Changing
any of this reloads the integration and the sidebar updates immediately.

Two limits worth knowing before you wonder why a page is blank:

- A page served over **http cannot be embedded in a Home Assistant served over
  https**. Browsers block the mixed content and Home Assistant shows an error in
  place of the frame. Put the gateway behind the same kind of TLS Home Assistant
  uses, or open it in its own tab.
- The embedded app keeps **its own login**. Signing in to Home Assistant does
  not sign you in to the Web App; that session lives in the frame and persists
  there like it would in a tab.

## Incoming events

Sending is only half a gateway. **Configure → Incoming events** ticks what the
gateway should tell Home Assistant about:

| Event | Fires as | Carries |
|---|---|---|
| `sms:received` | `gsmnode_sms_received` | `phone_number`, `message`, `received_at`, `sim_slot`, `encrypted` |
| `sms:sent` · `sms:delivered` · `sms:failed` | `gsmnode_sms_sent` … | `message_id`, `phone_numbers`, `status`, `error` |
| `sms:data-received` | `gsmnode_sms_data_received` | the above plus `data_payload`, `data_port` |
| `mms:received` · `mms:downloaded` | `gsmnode_mms_received` … | the above plus `subject`, `attachments` |
| `call:received` · `call:sent` · `call:failed` | `gsmnode_call_received` … | `call_id`, `phone_number`, `direction`, `status`, `started_at`, `duration` |

Nothing has to be registered by hand at either end. Home Assistant mints a
webhook of its own when the entry is created, and the integration subscribes
that URL with the API Server for exactly the ticked events — unticking removes
the subscription again, and deleting the integration unsubscribes it entirely.
Only subscriptions carrying this Home Assistant's webhook id are touched, so
anything you registered yourself in the Web App is left alone.

To use one, build an automation (**Settings → Automations → Create**), choose
the **Event** trigger, and give it the event type from the table — the options
form prints the exact names your current selection produces. Every event also
carries `device_id` and `created_at`, and the payload is flattened to the top
level, so a template reads `trigger.event.data.phone_number` directly:

```yaml
# What the UI editor produces — you never have to write this by hand.
triggers:
  - trigger: event
    event_type: gsmnode_sms_received
actions:
  - action: persistent_notification.create
    data:
      title: "SMS from {{ trigger.event.data.phone_number }}"
      message: "{{ trigger.event.data.message }}"
```

Two things to know:

- The gateway has to be able to **reach Home Assistant**. The address used is
  the one Home Assistant knows itself by (internal first, external as a
  fallback); if the gateway needs a different one, set it in the same form.
- With **end-to-end encryption** on, `phone_number` and `message` arrive as
  `gsmenc:v1:…` ciphertext. Home Assistant has no passphrase and cannot read
  them — this integration does not do E2E.

## Notification targets

A notify entity is called with a message and nothing else — `notify.send_message`
has no field for a recipient, a phone or a SIM. So each **notification target**
decides all of that up front, and you add one per combination you need. They
appear on the integration's page under **Add notification target**:

| Field | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Name** | names the entity — "Alerts" gives `notify.alerts` |
| **Send as** | SMS, MMS, or a call that rings the recipients |
| **Recipients** | every message to this target goes to all of them |
| **Phone** | which gateway phone sends it, from a picker |
| **SIM** | picked from the phone's actual SIMs — carrier and number, not a slot index |
| **MMS subject** | used when nothing passes a title with the message |

```yaml
action: notify.send_message
target:
  entity_id: notify.alerts
data:
  message: "Washing machine finished"
```

The SIM is a second step, because what it can offer depends on the phone chosen
in the first. The phones report their own SIMs on every heartbeat — slot,
carrier, number — so the list reads *SIM 1 (slot 0) — Orange · +48555111222*
rather than asking for a slot index. Leave it empty for the phone's default SIM.

Two things make that list empty, and both fall back to typing a slot number: a
phone that has not been granted the phone permission reports no SIMs at all, and
a gateway that is unreachable has nothing to report. With no phone chosen, every
phone's SIMs are offered, collapsed by slot — the stored value is the slot, so
two phones' "SIM 1" is one choice that names both.

Each target gets its own device and entity, so an alert can text the family from
one SIM while an escalation rings the on-call phone from the other. Editing a
target — or deleting it — is on the same page. An MMS target accepts a `title:`
and sends it as the subject.

For anything that has to choose per message, use `gsmnode.send`, which takes all
the same fields as arguments.

> Replaced the single `notify.gsmnode` entity of 3.0.0, and the YAML platform
> before it. If you had either, add a target here instead.

## How it works

- On first use it logs in (`POST /api/auth/login`) and caches the token; on a
  `401` it re-logs in once and retries, and gives up into a reauth prompt if
  that fails too.
- `send_sms` → `POST /api/messages`; `call` → `POST /api/calls`.
- Every 30s one coordinator polls `GET /api/health` and `GET /api/devices` and
  feeds both the gateway sensor and the per-phone ones. An unreachable server
  turns the sensor **off** rather than making it *unavailable* — reporting that
  is the sensor's whole job.
- All HTTP uses Home Assistant's shared aiohttp session (fully async), with a
  15s timeout per request.
- The sidebar item is an iframe panel (`frontend.async_register_built_in_panel`)
  registered when the entry loads and removed when it unloads. Nothing is
  proxied through Home Assistant — the browser fetches the page straight from
  the gateway.
- `gsmnode.send` posts to `/api/messages` for an SMS or MMS and `/api/calls` for
  a call; the SIM slot is 0-based on the wire in both. Choosing a SIM for a
  **call** needs an API Server and Phone Agent from this repo at or after the
  same commit — older ones accept the field and ignore it.
- MMS attachments are read in an executor, checked against
  `allowlist_external_dirs`, capped at 1 MB each, and base64'd into the request.
- The SIM list is built from `GET /api/devices`, which the coordinator already
  polls. The logic lives in `sims.py`, kept free of Home Assistant imports so
  `tests/test_sims.py` can exercise it with plain Python:
  `python -m unittest discover tests`.
- Incoming events use Home Assistant's own webhook component. The id is minted
  once per entry and stored with it, the URL is `GET`-proof (`POST` only), and
  each delivery is re-fired on the bus. Subscriptions on the gateway are
  reconciled on every load, so the set on the server always matches the ticks in
  the form.

## Security

Worth understanding before this carries anything that matters.

**Use https if the gateway is not on a network you trust.** Over plain http the
login sends your gateway password in the request body, the token that follows
rides in a header, and message text and recipient numbers are readable to
anything on the path. The client uses Home Assistant's shared session, which
validates certificates — so https gives real protection, and a self-signed
certificate will be refused with no override. The API Server speaks http only,
so https means putting a reverse proxy in front of it.

**Incoming deliveries are signed.** The webhook URL alone is a weak credential:
the gateway knows it, stores it, and anything that learns it could otherwise
post a forged `sms:received` that automations would act on. So the integration
mints a secret per entry, hands it to the gateway at registration, and the
gateway signs every delivery:

```
X-GsmNode-Timestamp: 1700000000
X-GsmNode-Signature: sha256=<hmac-sha256 of "<timestamp>.<body>">
```

Anything unsigned, wrongly signed, or more than five minutes old is answered
`401` and never reaches the bus. The timestamp is inside the MAC, so a captured
delivery cannot be replayed by rewriting its header. When the gateway reaches
Home Assistant on the local network, the webhook is additionally registered
`local_only`, so a forged request from outside is refused before any of this.

**What is still worth knowing:**

- The gateway password is stored in the config entry, which Home Assistant
  writes unencrypted to `.storage/core.config_entries`. Filesystem or backup
  access to the Home Assistant host gives up that password. The session token
  itself is only ever held in memory.
- Messages sent from here are **not** end-to-end encrypted, so the API Server
  and its database can read them, unlike ones composed in the Web App.
- The sidebar panel loads the gateway straight into your browser, so http there
  is your browser's plaintext, and the gateway login is typed into that frame.

## Brand assets

`brand/` holds what Home Assistant shows for the integration itself, in the
layout and sizes its [brands repository](https://github.com/home-assistant/brands)
requires — a local `brand/` folder wins over the CDN, so nothing has to be
submitted upstream:

| File | Source (design kit) | Size |
|---|---|---|
| `icon.png` | `app-icon-512.png`, scaled | 256×256 |
| `icon@2x.png` | `app-icon-512.png` | 512×512 |
| `logo.png` | `lockup-horizontal-color.png` | 936×224 |
| `dark_logo.png` | `lockup-horizontal-white.png` | 936×224 |

The icon is the app tile — signal-green with white arrows — which stays legible
on either theme, so no `dark_icon.png` is needed. The wordmark does need both:
`logo.png` sets "gsm" in ink, `dark_logo.png` in white. There is no
`logo@2x.png`; the widest lockup in the kit is 936×224, and its short side would
have to be upscaled to reach the hDPI range.

## Notes / limitations

- The API Server must be reachable from the Home Assistant host.
- No external dependencies (`requirements: []`).
- SIM slots are **0-based** here and everywhere else in gsmnode: slot `0` is the
  first SIM. (A phone's sensor lists its slots and carriers in its attributes.)
- Only plain SMS and calls are wired up. The API Server also accepts **MMS**
  (`type: mms` with subject/attachments) and **data SMS** (`type: data`); those
  have no service here yet.
- **End-to-end encryption is not supported.** Messages sent from here are
  plaintext and flagged as such, so a Phone Agent with a passphrase still sends
  them fine — but the API Server can read them, unlike ones composed in the Web
  App. Incoming SMS relayed to a HA webhook likewise arrive as ciphertext if the
  Phone Agent encrypted them.

## Where this comes from

The integration is one surface of **gsmnode**, which also has an API Server, a
Web App, and two Android apps — a Phone Agent that does the sending and a Phone
App that manages the gateway. Those live in the project's own repository,
[gsmnode/gsmnode](https://github.com/gsmnode/gsmnode); this one holds
the Home Assistant integration alone, because HACS requires
`custom_components/<domain>/` at the root of the repository it installs from.

It is published by splitting that folder out, so the history here is the real
history of the integration and not a squash. Issues and pull requests are
welcome here; changes are merged upstream and land back on the next release.
